Early life and education
Barbara Neely was born in Pittsburgh in 1941,[4] was the oldest of three children born to Ann and Bernard Neely who lived in a rural Pennsylvania Dutch community in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.[5][6]

She attended a Roman Catholic elementary school and was the only child in her class of Pennsylvania German dialect (popularly known as Pennsylvania Dutch) students to speak English fluently and was the only student of African American descent to attend her elementary and high school. In 1971, she moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where she was awarded a Masters degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Pittsburgh.[5][6]

Activism
After earning her degree, she became thoroughly involved in local activism and created a community based housing program for female felons in an area of Pittsburgh called Shady Side. The program was developed through her position with Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections and was the state's first community based correctional center for women.[5][7]

During a trip to San Francisco in 1978, Neely witnessed a woman dancing in front of a band which she says inspired her to take her work in activism even farther. Neely stated, "she [the dancing woman] started pointing to people, and when she turned and pointed to me, it seemed to me that she was saying, 'Do it today, because today is all you have.'"[8] Soon after, Neely had her first piece of fiction, a short story called "Passing the Word", published in Essence magazine. Neely moved to North Carolina and began writing for Southern Exposure as well as producing various shows for the African News Service.[8] Her involvement in activism continued with becoming director of a YWCA branch, Family Services Coordinator for ABCD Head Start, executive director of Women for Economic Justice, cofounder (with Loretta Ross, and others) of Women of Color for Reproductive Freedom,[9] and host of "Commonwealth Journal" on Boston Radio.[10] She was also part of an evaluative research team at the Institute for Social Research.[5]

Publishing career
Neely published her first short story, "Passing the Word" (1981) in the magazine Essence. Her Blanche White novels followed a decade later beginning with Blanche on the Lam[11] (1992), followed by Blanche Among the Talented Tenth[12] (1994), Blanche Cleans Up[13] (1998), and Blanche Passes Go[14] (2000). Most notable about Barbara Neely's heroine Blanche is both her physical appearance as well as her occupation; she is a heavy-set, dark-skinned Black woman who works as a maid. Blanche is proud of her work and does not let it get in the way of her independence and proud personality. This immediately sets her apart from the typical protagonist. Other notable characteristics of Blanche are her curiosity, and her ability to piece together clues in order to figure out mysteries.[8]

Neely died on March 2, 2020 at the age of 78 after a short illness.[4][15][16]Early life and education
Barbara Neely was born in Pittsburgh in 1941,[4] was the oldest of three children born to Ann and Bernard Neely who lived in a rural Pennsylvania Dutch community in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.[5][6]

She attended a Roman Catholic elementary school and was the only child in her class of Pennsylvania German dialect (popularly known as Pennsylvania Dutch) students to speak English fluently and was the only student of African American descent to attend her elementary and high school. In 1971, she moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where she was awarded a Masters degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Pittsburgh.[5][6]

Activism
After earning her degree, she became thoroughly involved in local activism and created a community based housing program for female felons in an area of Pittsburgh called Shady Side. The program was developed through her position with Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections and was the state's first community based correctional center for women.[5][7]

During a trip to San Francisco in 1978, Neely witnessed a woman dancing in front of a band which she says inspired her to take her work in activism even farther. Neely stated, "she [the dancing woman] started pointing to people, and when she turned and pointed to me, it seemed to me that she was saying, 'Do it today, because today is all you have.'"[8] Soon after, Neely had her first piece of fiction, a short story called "Passing the Word", published in Essence magazine. Neely moved to North Carolina and began writing for Southern Exposure as well as producing various shows for the African News Service.[8] Her involvement in activism continued with becoming director of a YWCA branch, Family Services Coordinator for ABCD Head Start, executive director of Women for Economic Justice, cofounder (with Loretta Ross, and others) of Women of Color for Reproductive Freedom,[9] and host of "Commonwealth Journal" on Boston Radio.[10] She was also part of an evaluative research team at the Institute for Social Research.[5]

Publishing career
Neely published her first short story, "Passing the Word" (1981) in the magazine Essence. Her Blanche White novels followed a decade later beginning with Blanche on the Lam[11] (1992), followed by Blanche Among the Talented Tenth[12] (1994), Blanche Cleans Up[13] (1998), and Blanche Passes Go[14] (2000). Most notable about Barbara Neely's heroine Blanche is both her physical appearance as well as her occupation; she is a heavy-set, dark-skinned Black woman who works as a maid. Blanche is proud of her work and does not let it get in the way of her independence and proud personality. This immediately sets her apart from the typical protagonist. Other notable characteristics of Blanche are her curiosity, and her ability to piece together clues in order to figure out mysteries.[8]

Blanche is proud of her work and does not let it get in the way of her independence and proud personality. This immediately sets her apart from the typical protagonist. Other notable characteristics of Blanche are her curiosity, and her ability to piece together clues in order to figure out mysteries.[8]

Death
Neely died on March 2, 2020 at the age of 78 after a short illness.[4][15][16]Early life and education
Barbara Neely was born in Pittsburgh in 1941,[4] was the oldest of three children born to Ann and Bernard Neely who lived in a rural Pennsylvania Dutch community in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.[5][6]

She attended a Roman Catholic elementary school and was the only child in her class of Pennsylvania German dialect (popularly known as Pennsylvania Dutch) students to speak English fluently and was the only student of African American descent to attend her elementary and high school. In 1971, she moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where she was awarded a Masters degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Pittsburgh.[5][6]

Activism
After earning her degree, she became thoroughly involved in local activism and created a community based housing program for female felons in an area of Pittsburgh called Shady Side. The program was developed through her position with Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections and was the state's first community based correctional center for women.[5][7]

During a trip to San Francisco in 1978, Neely witnessed a woman dancing in front of a band which she says inspired her to take her work in activism even farther. Neely stated, "she [the dancing woman] started pointing to people, and when she turned and pointed to me, it seemed to me that she was saying, 'Do it today, because today is all you have.'"[8] Soon after, Neely had her first piece of fiction, a short story called "Passing the Word", published in Essence magazine. Neely moved to North Carolina and began writing for Southern Exposure as well as producing various shows for the African News Service.[8] Her involvement in activism continued with becoming director of a YWCA branch, Family Services Coordinator for ABCD Head Start, executive director of Women for Economic Justice, cofounder (with Loretta Ross, and others) of Women of Color for Reproductive Freedom,[9] and host of "Commonwealth Journal" on Boston Radio.[10] She was also part of an evaluative research team at the Institute for Social Research.[5]

Neely published her first short story, "Passing the Word" (1981) in the magazine Essence. Her Blanche White novels followed a decade later beginning with Blanche on the Lam[11] (1992), followed by Blanche Among the Talented Tenth[12] (1994), Blanche Cleans Up[13] (1998), and Blanche Passes Go[14] (2000). Most notable about Barbara Neely's heroine Blanche is both her physical appearance as well as her occupation; she is a heavy-set, dark-skinned Black woman who works as a maid. Blanche is proud of her work and does not let it get in the way of her independence and proud personality. This immediately sets her apart from the typical protagonist. Other notable characteristics of Blanche are her curiosity, and her ability to piece together clues in order to figure out mysteries.[8]

Death
Neely died on March 2, 2020 at the age of 78 after a short illness.[4][15][16]Early life and education
Barbara Neely was born in Pittsburgh in 1941,[4] was the oldest of three children born to Ann and Bernard Neely who lived in a rural Pennsylvania Dutch community in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.[5][6]

She attended a Roman Catholic elementary school and was the only child in her class of Pennsylvania German dialect (popularly known as Pennsylvania Dutch) students to speak English fluently and was the only student of African American descent to attend her elementary and high school. In 1971, she moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where she was awarded a Masters degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Pittsburgh.[5][6]

Activism
After earning her degree, she became thoroughly involved in local activism and created a community based housing program for female felons in an area of Pittsburgh called Shady Side. The program was developed through her position with Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections and was the state's first community based correctional center for women.[5][7]

During a trip to San Francisco in 1978, Neely witnessed a woman dancing in front of a band which she says inspired her to take her work in activism even farther. Neely stated, "she [the dancing woman] started pointing to people, and when she turned and pointed to me, it seemed to me that she was saying, 'Do it today, because today is all you have.'"[8] Soon after, Neely had her first piece of fiction, a short story called "Passing the Word", published in Essence magazine. Neely moved to North Carolina and began writing for Southern Exposure as well as producing various shows for the African News Service.[8] Her involvement in activism continued with becoming director of a YWCA branch, Family Services Coordinator for ABCD Head Start, executive director of Women for Economic Justice, cofounder (with Loretta Ross, and others) of Women of Color for Reproductive Freedom,[9] and host of "Commonwealth Journal" on Boston Radio.[10] She was also part of an evaluative research team at the Institute for Social Research.[5]

Neely stated, "she [the dancing woman] started pointing to people, and when she turned and pointed to me, it seemed to me that she was saying, 'Do it today, because today is all you have.'"[8] Soon after, Neely had her first piece of fiction, a short story called "Passing the Word", published in Essence magazine. Neely moved to North Carolina and began writing for Southern Exposure as well as producing various shows for the African News Service.[8] Her involvement in activism continued with becoming director of a YWCA branch, Family Services Coordinator for ABCD Head Start, executive director of Women for Economic Justice, cofounder (with Loretta Ross, and others) of Women of Color for Reproductive Freedom,[9] and host of "Commonwealth Journal" on Boston Radio.[10] She was also part of an evaluative research team at the Institute for Social Research.[5]

Publishing career
Neely published her first short story, "Passing the Word" (1981) in the magazine Essence. Her Blanche White novels followed a decade later beginning with Blanche on the Lam[11] (1992), followed by Blanche Among the Talented Tenth[12] (1994), Blanche Cleans Up[13] (1998), and Blanche Passes Go[14] (2000). Most notable about Barbara Neely's heroine Blanche is both her physical appearance as well as her occupation; she is a heavy-set, dark-skinned Black woman who works as a maid. Blanche is proud of her work and does not let it get in the way of her independence and proud personality. This immediately sets her apart from the typical protagonist. Other notable characteristics of Blanche are her curiosity, and her ability to piece together clues in order to figure out mysteries.[8]
